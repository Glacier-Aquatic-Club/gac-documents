                    <li><strong>Hydration is Key:</strong> Swimmers should bring a water bottle to every practice and sip throughout. Avoid sugary drinks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fueling for Practice:</strong> A light, carbohydrate-rich snack 30-60 minutes before practice can provide needed energy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Meet Day Nutrition:</strong> Pack healthy, easily digestible snacks like fruit, granola bars, yogurt, and small sandwiches. Avoid heavy, greasy, or overly sugary foods.</li>

                 <ul class="mt-2 list-decimal list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Sign-ups:</strong> Register for meets on the team website before the deadline. Coaches will help swimmers choose appropriate events.</li>
                    <li><strong>Psych Sheet:</strong> A few days before the meet, a list of all swimmers ranked by seed time is sent out. This is not the final schedule.</li>
                    <li><strong>Heat Sheet:</strong> At the meet, purchase a program (heat sheet). This is the official timeline and lists every swimmer's event, heat, and lane number.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check-in:</strong> Swimmers must check in with a coach upon arrival for warm-ups, and before and after every race for feedback.</li>
                    <li><strong>Results:</strong> Official times are posted at the meet. The "Meet Mobile" app is also a popular tool for live, unofficial results.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check-out:</strong> Swimmers MUST check out with a coach before leaving for the day.</li>

                        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-1">A Disqualification, or DQ, happens if a stroke is performed illegally. Don't worry! Every swimmer gets DQ'd. It's a learning opportunity.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-1">Just keep swimming! It's better to finish the race without them than to stop.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-1">Swimmers are "seeded" into heats based on their best times, not their age. Final results are always broken down by age group (8 & Under, 9-10, etc.).</p>
